Post a README and screenshots in `/entries/{username}`.

In your README, include everything someone would need to access your project.

If your project is very simple only has a few files, you can include your code in your entry so other challengers can see it. Otherwise you can link to your repository (if you'd like to share your code).

## How to submit a PR
- Create a folder here with your GitHub username (i.e. `/entries/{username}`)
- Add a README with instructions for viewing your project.
- If applicable, add a screenshot of the project.
